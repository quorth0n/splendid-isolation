# splendid-isolation

Simple vic2 mod to copy the setting from HFM. Should be compatible with all other mods.

Behavior is identitical to HFM from the player's perspective: UK will break all GP alliances on month tick except for Portugal, Belgium, Japan, and Ottos until 1890. This can be disabled at any time by running `event 99957` in the game console or turning off the mod.

## Installation

1. Click Code > Download zip
2. Extract isolation.mod and isolation/ to your mod directory
3. Select your normal playset and 'Splendid Isolation' in the launcher
